# Observations from contributing to Open Source

## Heng Le (Visual Studio Code):

* Very beginner friendly, handholds new developers (directing them to the files to edit etc.)
* Bot that recommends reviewers for PRs based on file history
* Coding guidelines are very short and less daunting

## Ian Teo (freeCodeCamp):

* Open source is not as daunting as it seems
* Have available avenues for developers to seek help if they need help with the code base (i.e. Gitter, which is better than Github issues because people don't need to create account) 
* Use of labels like help-wanted and first-timers-only to encourage new developers
* Have a template for PR submission so the developer doesn't leave out important information

## Ang Shi Ya (freeCodeCamp):

* Much more welcoming for new developers to contribute
* Documents are written more friendly and informally (e.g. like a conversation) which is less of a turn off
* Documentation encourages developers to contribute (compared to PowerPointLabs which has things like 'Don't do this or your PR will not get merged')

## Jamos (freeCodeCamp):

* Dev setup is very clearly documented
* Clear step by step instructions of how to set up the dev environment, test if everything is working and avenues to seek help if something goes wrong
* Resources available such as style guides, and standards ensure the product quality stays consistent

## Syed (pdf.js):

* Mostly consists of Mozilla contributors
* Issue tracker is used as a help desk: issues describe problems users have with the product and how to reproduce them
* Contact form with template provided
* Use of tags such as 'broken in 2010' allows classification of issues
* bot.io: runs test cases when needed, activated by commenting on PR. Can run specific segments of tests that change

## Kenneth (freeCodeCamp)

* Better documentation for motivation behind product design decisions to allow contributors to understand
* Checklist system for people making PRs
* PRs focus on repaying technical debt rather than just developing new features
